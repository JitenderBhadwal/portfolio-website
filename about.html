                    <p> Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Jatinder Bhadwal, a passionate and aspiring
                        Computer
                        Science student eager to embark on a journey into the world of Computer Science.

                        As a fresher, I bring a unique blend of enthusiasm, creativity, and a hunger to learn. My
                        educational
                        background has provided me with a strong foundation in Software Engineering, Mathematics,
                        Machine Learning,
                        web development, Databases, Data Structures and algorithms and last but not the least Problem
                        solving and I
                        am excited to apply these skills to real-world projects and challenges.

                        My journey into computer science began with a curiosity about how things work and a fascination
                        with the
                        possibilities that technology and creativity can unlock. This curiosity led me to pursue study
                        in data
                        science, machine learning, and web development during my time at Chandigarh University, where I
                        had the
                        opportunity to learn Real-world Application, professional skills, specialized knowledge and
                        Problem-solving.

                        I am dedicated to continuous improvement and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and
                        technologies in
                        computer science. I believe that learning is a lifelong process, and I am committed to honing my
                        skills and
                        expanding my knowledge in ML and software development.

                        In addition to my technical skills, I bring strong communication and teamwork abilities to the
                        table. I
                        believe that collaboration is the key to success, and I enjoy working with diverse teams to
                        solve complex
                        problems and bring innovative ideas to life.

                        Beyond the professional realm, I am an avid newspaper reader, book reader and yoga practitioner.
                        These
                        activities not only provide balance to my life but also fuel my creativity and problem-solving
                        abilities.

                        I've created this portfolio to showcase my journey, my projects, and my potential. I invite you
                        to explore
                        my work and get to know me better. If you're interested in collaborating, have questions, or
                        simply want to

                        excited to

                        lie ahead
